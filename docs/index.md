# Harper

Harper is a terminal-first AI agent for code and shell work. It keeps command execution visible, supports approval-gated workflows, tracks multi-step work explicitly, and maintains an audit trail instead of hiding what it did.

## Features

- **Visible command execution**: Harper shows the concrete commands it plans to run
- **Approval gates**: Sensitive or higher-risk operations can require confirmation
- **Session and plan tracking**: Conversations, titles, audit logs, and plans persist with the session
- **Provider support**: Works with OpenAI, Gemini, SambaNova, Cerebras, and Ollama
- **TUI and batch flows**: Use the interactive terminal UI or verify behavior headlessly with `harper-batch`
