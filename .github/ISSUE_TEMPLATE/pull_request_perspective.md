Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project. We really appreciate you taking the time to submit a pull request.

Before we can merge your work, our team will need to write the mocks and test cases on our end. We will take care of this after you submit.

This process helps us make sure everything works properly with our systems. We understand this might take some time.

Our founders will work on this project in the future. We want everything to be properly set up for them too.
